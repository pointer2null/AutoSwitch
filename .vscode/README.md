# VSCODE

I've added this because I have tried to use VSCode to edit the code. It's a much better editor and a lot easier to user. However, it doesn't always seem to integrate properly with the Arduino. In this case it actually manage to find and understand my includes, but was unable to find the programmer type. I also had to manually edit the config files to set the board type correctly.
